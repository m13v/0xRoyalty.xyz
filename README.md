## Description
0xRoyalty is a developer leaderboard (linking protocol commercial results to developer contributions).
### Problem
While top web3 protocols make billions, developers donâ€™t get deserved credit, nor royalties.
### Insight
Most projects are forks. And all code contributions are traceable and public.
### Solution
We build Trustless reputation system for developers, algorithm + datasets.
Every developer can propose improvements to reputation algorithm. Everyone can supply new datasets to feed reputation algorithm.

## Architecture and used dependencies
### Current state
<p align="center"><div style="text-align: center;"><img src="how.png" alt="0xRoyalty" width="1000"/></div></p>

* Our backend is gathering all necessary statistics like web3 app/protocol usage and feed, statistics about contribution from the related GitHub repositories.
* Then metadata about the project is uploaded to the [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/)
* Project information added/updated on-chain with our smart contract written for FEVM 
* Any client (like our frontend) could retrieve the data about all projects tracked from the smart contract + all meta information about particular project from [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/)

### Potential further improvements
* Support more stats providers except Dune. + consider our own on-chain analytics.
* Support not only GitHub.
* Add community engagements like votings, common community driven lists of projects etc.
* Add options to integrate with existing DAO tooling.
